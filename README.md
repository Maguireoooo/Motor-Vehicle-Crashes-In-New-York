# Dataset Description and Overview:
The dataset we used was found on the public website data.gov, titled: Motor Vehicle Collisions â€“ Crashes (New York City)
This data contains motorvehicle crashes that were reported from 1998 to 2025 in different areas of New York City. It contains 2,169,687 rows and 30 columns making it a large and rich dataset full of varied categorical and quantitive data. 
Before going in depth with this data, we must first understand the different variables that we analyzed. 
We first began with the categorical set: 
* Borough (which town the crash happened in)
* Type of Vehicle (sedan, SUV, taxi, or for-hire vehicle like Uber/Lyft)
* Cause of Crash (texting, speeding, weather, under the influence, etc.)
* Time of Day (morning, afternoon, evening, night)

Then with the quantitative set: 
* Fatality Rate 
* Number of Crashes
* Number of Pedestrian Injuries

This detailed dataset allowed us to gain a hold of both WHERE and WHY accidents happen. Along with this, we attempted to determine which vehicle types and locations are most dangerous for pedestrians across New York City.
